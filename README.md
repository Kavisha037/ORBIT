## 💡 The Problem
In the technology field, students and professionals struggle to maintain focus. Distractions are everywhere, and "watching a tutorial" often turns into "mindlessly scrolling." There is no system to verify deep work or active learning.

## 🛠️ The Solution
*Master Your Focus* is a productivity ecosystem designed for developers and students. Unlike standard to-do lists, our platform enforces discipline through active verification and IDE synchronization.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. 🧠 Focus Mode
* *Distraction Blocking:* Automatically blocks distracting sites when a session starts.
* *AI Motivation:* Real-time AI nudges to keep you locked in.

### 2. 📺 Video Mastery (Visual Learning)
* *Strict Verification:* Ensures the video is playing, unmuted, and that you are actually watching.
* *Curated Resources:* Integrated with high-quality courses (e.g., Selenium WebDriver, Python, Java).

### 3. 💻 Deep Coding (IDE Sync)
* *VS Code Integration:* The session stays active only while you are actively writing code.
* *Activity Tracking:* Measures actual coding time, not just time spent with the app open.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
* *Frontend:* HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React/Next.js? [Update this if you used a framework])
* *Backend/Database:* Firebase Studio
* *Tools:* [Any other tools, e.g., GitHub, VS Code API]
